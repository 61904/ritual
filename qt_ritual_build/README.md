qt_build_tools
==============

Build script implementation for Rust Qt crates.

The build script uses `qmake` available in `PATH` to determine paths to the Qt installation and passes them to [cpp_to_rust_build_tools](https://github.com/rust-qt/cpp_to_rust/tree/master/cpp_to_rust/cpp_to_rust_build_tools).

See [README](https://github.com/rust-qt/cpp_to_rust) of the repository root for more information about other parts of the project.
